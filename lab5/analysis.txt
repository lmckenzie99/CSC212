The top-k algorithm for finding the top-K elements of a set of 
n integers uses a max-heap data structure.

Operation:
Read all integers from the input file into a vector.

Build a max-heap containing all n elements using the make_heap function.
Extract the k largest elements from the max-heap by repeatedly:

Retrieve the maximum element
Remove it from the heap
Add it to a result vector

Sort the k extracted elements in descending order.
Output the sorted elements.

Analysis:

Reading the input: O(n)
Building the max-heap: O(n)
Extracting elements: O(k log n)
Sorting k elements is O(k log k)
Ouputting k elements is O(k)

Overall:

O(n) + O(n) + O(k log n) + O(k log k) + O(k)

Which can be simplified to O(n + k log n)
